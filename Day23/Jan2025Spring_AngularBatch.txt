			})
			export class EmployeeComponent{
			
			
			}
			
			app.module.ts

			app.component.html
			<app-employee>

2 Data Binding 
	- To  display data dynamically to the end use for that we use data binding 
	- data flow will be in one way direction & two way direction
	- It has 2 types 
		1 One way data binding 
			- data flow from from component file to view file 
			1 string interpolation
			2 property binding
			3 style binding
			4 class binding
			
		2 Two way data binding

3 string interpolation
data type 
	string (''/""), number(int, float,double,long,short),boolean(true/false),any(string/number/boolean)
	void => it is a neutral data type 
	null & undefined => it can be used value as well as data type type 
	
	n1:null or n1:any=null;
	Literal 
	n2 : string | null;
	n3: number | string;
	
	<h2> {{name}}<h2>
	<h2> {{num +num}}</h2>
	<h2> {{isDisplay ? name :"s..."	
	
	.ts 
	name:string='';
	num:number=4;
	isDisplay:boolean=true;
	
	
4 Property Binding	
	<input [value]="name">
	.ts 
	
	name:string='';
5 String interpolation VS Property Binding	
	<div hidden=" {{isHiden}} ">
	...
	
	<div [hidden]="isHiden">
	
	.ts 
	isHiden:boolean=false;
